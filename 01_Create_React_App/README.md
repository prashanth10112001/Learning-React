# WELCOME TO LEARN REACT

## This is the first app that we are going to build from scratch - ðŸ˜‰

## Step - 1

1. Create an `index.html` file in a folder.
2. Then make a div tag with `root`.
3. Then add the script tags to create our index.html.

```html
<script
  crossorigin
  src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"
></script>
<script
  crossorigin
  src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"
></script>
```

4. To start the server we have to type this command in the terminal `npx serve`, then click ok to install required packages.
